# Array Manipulation Examples

This section provides examples for processing and manipulating array fields contained in documents, without having to _unwind_ and _re-group_ the content of each array.

You should ensure you have read the [Advanced Use Of Expressions For Array Processing](../../guides/advanced-arrays.md) chapter first before digesting the examples in this book's section.
