# Full-Text Search Examples

This section provides examples for building an aggregation pipeline to perform a full-text search on one or more fields of documents in a collection.

The examples leverage Lucene-based search indexes delivered by [Atlas Search](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/). Consequently, using these aggregations is only possible with an [Atlas Cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) rather than a self-installed MongoDB deployment.
