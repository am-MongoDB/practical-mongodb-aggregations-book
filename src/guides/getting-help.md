# Getting Help

No one can hold in their heads, the names of all the different stages and operators available in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework, and their specific syntax. I'd bet even _MongoDB Aggregations Royalty_ ([Asya Kamsky](http://www.kamsky.org/stupid-tricks-with-mongodb)) couldn't, although I'm sure she would give it a good go! &#128518;

The good news is there is no need to try to remember all the stages & operators. The MongoDB online documentation provides a set of excellent _references_ for these, here:

 * MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline [Stages reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/)
 * MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline [Operators reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)
 
Additionally, if you are getting stuck with an aggregation pipeline and want some help, there is an active online community out there who will invariably have the answer. So just pose your questions at either:

 * The MongoDB Developer Hub - [Community Forums](https://developer.mongodb.com/community/forums/)
 * Stack Overflow - [MongoDB Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb)

You may be asking for just general advice. However, if you are asking for help on a specific aggregation pipeline that you are currently prototyping, it is highly recommanded to provide a sample input document and a copy of your current pipeline code (in its JSON syntax format, and not a programming language specific format). This helps maximise the likelihood of you receiving a timely and optimal response.
